Joining different data isn't that difficult to do in Excel if you use Index and Match.

Let's start out with this [index_match.xlsx](http://andrewbatran.com/ewa/index_match.xlsx) so we have something simple to work with.

Download and open the file in Excel. 

It should look like this:

The goal here is to bring the tax figure associated with the city in the second table up to the first table.

Let's first start with the =match() function.

This is the formula.

=match(lookup_value, lookup_array, [match_type])

Start typing it out in cell D2. =match(

Now select the lookup_value, which in this instance will be New York. Select C2.

Put in a comma, and select the lookup_array, as in which cells to look for the "New York."

Select the range of cells in the second table where all the city name cells are: B13:B15.

That's all you need at this point. Press enter to run the formula and apply the formula to all the cells in the top table.

You'll see something wrong.

**What happened?**

It's the formula. We need to add anchors to the lookup_array so that it doesn't move down one with every cell below.

Go back to the formula and add the anchors like B$13:B$15.

Congrats, that works.

New York matches the third entry in the selected array.

Denver matches the first entry in the selected array.

London matches the second entry in the selected array.

Now that we have match() working successfully, we bring in index().

In front of match() but in front of the = sign, add index(

and then select the array that you want to bring over when matched.

So select the tax cells next to the cities in the second table.

DONT FORGET TO ADD THE ANCHORS ($).

Add a comma.

So in the end you have =INDEX(C$13:C$15, MATCH(C2, B$13:kB$15))

Apply that formula to the cells below and you'll have everything you need!

Don't forget to copy and paste values only to get rid of the formula.

You can do it on the flip side.

Let's do it for region.

Do the match() formula as before.

If it worked correctly, you'll have the number of row where it matches in the second table.

OK, now type in the index formula and select a new index array. 

This time we're selecting the cells to the left of the city column, under region.

Make sure you add the anchors and apply the formula to the other cells.

Looks good! You've joined data.

Great job.
