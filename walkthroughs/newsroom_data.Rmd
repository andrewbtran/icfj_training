This walkthrough will show you how to make pivot tables in Excel. Pivot tables is a way to summarize and explore data interactively. It helps extract what might be significant from a large, detailed data set. 

We'll be working with the Washington Post shootings [data](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings/raw/master/fatal-police-shootings-data.csv) (right click and save as). Pivot tables will let us answer questions like: 

Which states have the most shootings? Whatâ€™s the average age of victims?

### Setting up

First, open the *fatal-police-shootings-data.csv* file in Excel.

### Pivot

Select all the rows and columns with values (ctrl + a, cmd + a, or click the cell where the rows and column headers intersect), and then click on the **Insert** tab in the menu and click on the **PivotTable** icon at the top left.

Alternatively, instead of clicking the button, go to the menu under Data and select Summarize with Pivot Table.

Excel will make sure you've selected the right columns and rows and where you want to put it. 


These options are fine. Just click OK.

![](https://andrewbatran.com/ewa/pivot_tables/pivot4.png)


A new sheet will pop up with a blank grid. With a PivotTable Fields editor window on the right.

![](https://andrewbatran.com/ewa/pivot_tables/pivot5.png)


In **FIELD NAME** there are all the column names, such as id, name, date, manner_of_death, etc.



You'll see a few suggestions, like Count of name for each race or Count of distinct armed for each flee.

Then there are blank boxes for **Filters**, **Columns**, **Rows**, and **Values**. This is where we'll drag column names from Field Name into and build some summaries.

### PIVOT TABLES

Here's where you can explore the data interactively.

Let's start out with the first question: **Which states have the most shootings?**

### COUNT

On the right, in the window called PivotTableFields, click and drag state into the Rows box.

Now we've got rows of abbreviations of the states in the *state* column of raw data.

Next, drag *state* from **FIELD NAME** into the **Values** box.


![](https://andrewbatran.com/ewa/pivot_tables/pivot7.png)



This means, that you've counted up each instance of a particular state from the raw data.

Okay, I need to figure out quickly which state has the most. We can't sort the data within a Pivot Table.

We need to bring the data over into a new sheet. Click the plus button (+) at the bottom of the Spreadsheet to add a new blank sheet.

![](https://andrewbatran.com/ewa/pivot_tables/pivot8.png)


Go back to Sheet1 and select only the cells with the data (you don't need to grab the Grand Total part .

Copy it (right click + copy or cmd+c or ctrl+c).

![](https://andrewbatran.com/ewa/pivot_tables/pivot9.png)


Go to Sheet2 and paste in the new data.

![](https://andrewbatran.com/ewa/pivot_tables/pivot10.png)


Uh oh, that doesn't look right.

What happened? You've run into a common error when dealing with Spreadsheets.

You pasted the data, which includes the format of the pivot table. That doesn't translate correctly.

What you want to do is right click and select **Paste Special** (shortcut is ctrl+cmd+V).

![](https://andrewbatran.com/ewa/pivot_tables/pivot11.png)


And select **Values**.

![](https://andrewbatran.com/ewa/pivot_tables/pivot12.png)


and click **OK**.

![](https://andrewbatran.com/ewa/pivot_tables/pivot13.png)


There, that looks correct. Now, let's rename the columns: State and Shootings.

![](https://andrewbatran.com/ewa/pivot_tables/pivot14.png)


Alright, now let's click the **B** header above **Shootings** so it selects the whole column. 

Then click the **Sort & Filter** button under the **Home** tab and choose Sort Highest to Lowest. Go ahead and choose Expand Selection from the popup.

![](https://andrewbatran.com/ewa/pivot_tables/pivot15.png)


And this is what we get:


![](https://andrewbatran.com/ewa/pivot_tables/pivot16.png)



Alright, now we know that the top three states are California, Texas, and Florida.

That kind of makes sense because they're the states with the most population in the country.

Let's figure out the average age of the victims.

### AVERAGE

Go back to Sheet1 to the **PivotTable** Fields editor and drag *age* into the **Values** box.

![](https://andrewbatran.com/ewa/pivot_tables/pivot17.png)


The default summary will be **Sum**, which we don't want.

Click the ***i*** next to ***Sum of age*** and select *Average*.

![](https://andrewbatran.com/ewa/pivot_tables/pivot18.png)


Click OK.

![](https://andrewbatran.com/ewa/pivot_tables/pivot19.png)


Nice.

Copy and paste (values only) the new data into Sheet2 and sort it by Average Age of victim smallest to largest.

![](https://andrewbatran.com/ewa/pivot_tables/pivot20.png)


Iowa and Illinois have the youngest victims based on their average age.

### Columns

But that's if men and women are counted as one. What if we separated the two. Would the average age change the state rankings?

Go back to Sheet1 and drag gender from **FIELD NAME** into **Columns**. 

Choose *Gender*.

![](https://andrewbatran.com/ewa/pivot_tables/pivot22.png)


Let's explore this new summary. Copy the data and paste (values only) into Sheet2.

![](https://andrewbatran.com/ewa/pivot_tables/pivot23.png)


We need to rename the columns so we understand what's going on.

Call them **State**, **Female total**, **Male total**, **Female avg age**, **Male avg age**, **Total**, and **Avg age**.

![](https://andrewbatran.com/ewa/pivot_tables/pivot24.png)


Some new columns appear automatically, breaking out *Average of age* and *Count of state* but for **F** and **M**.

Let's sort the average age for women from smallest to largest.

![](https://andrewbatran.com/ewa/pivot_tables/pivot25.png)


The average age for women killed in Pennsylvania is 12. Granted, that's because only one woman was killed there, which skews the average.

Still, you can see how this is very powerful in looking for stories you your raw data.

Start with a question. **State with the most?**

Which leads to another question. **What about average age?**

Which leads to another. **Is lumping together men and women affecting the average age?**

We found an outlier. A 12-year-old girl was shot and killed in Pennsylvania.

Go back to Sheet1 and double click the 1 next to PA or the 12 and you'll get a new sheet focused just on her in the raw data.

![](https://andrewbatran.com/ewa/pivot_tables/pivot26.png)


Ciara Meyer was a white girl who was unarmed and not fleeing or showing signs of mental illness when she was shot and killed by police.

Pivot tables is a powerful and easy way to make sense of big data.
